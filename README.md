### Initial Proposal
Scribere, the infinite Latin verb, “to write,” will allow budding poets and short story authors to share their work in this online literary communal application. This fills a niche that really isn’t met on current social apps, where other users are more interested in seeing fleeting moments in pictures or single paragraphs.  

Scribere will provide a forum where authors can write poetry, short stories, or offer book reviews, as reading precedes and goes hand-in-hand with becoming a writer.  Writers may categorize their offerings, as well as add tags, and readers may offer comments and favorite articles and authors that they enjoy reading.
